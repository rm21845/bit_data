# Lab2: Data Aggregation, Big Data Analysis and Visualization
## Data-intensive Computing CSE587 Spring 2017
#### @author: Ron Davis

### Description: 
> The project involved aggregating Tweets and news articles on the basis of containing
> particular keywords: Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and Ethereum. After extrapolation, the 
> data was cleaned and words were omitted to reduce noise. After cleaning, the data was 
> then pulled through a MapReduce in Apache Hadoop. The operation allowed the data to show
> which words were most associated with the aforementioned keywords. The top ten words were
> then map reduced with every other word in each article to map co-occurences. After this analysis,
> a website was created with a d3.js front-end to visualize the results of the Hadoop MR. For further 
> explanation, please refer to the pdf documents.
